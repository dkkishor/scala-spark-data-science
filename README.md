* Functional - Compute by evaluating functions and minimizing need to maintain state.
* Compiles to Java Byte code which can run under JVM next to Java code.
* Staticially typed language.
* Other Languages for data science - Python & R
* Why Scala - Scalability (when working with large datasets) - Using Parallel Processing (Multiple cores, parallel collections)
* SQL connectivity with JDBC as in Java.
* Scalar Data Types - Byte, Short, Int, Long, Float, Double, Char
* Collections (mutable, immutable) - Sequences(Vectors, Streams, Lists, Queues, Strings, Stacks), Sets(HashSet, SortedSet, TreeSet, BitSet, ListSet), Maps(HashMaps, SortedMaps, TreeMaps, ListMaps)
